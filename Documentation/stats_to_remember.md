## Pair stats
* Given a high pair, like KxKx, there's a 100% chance you win. Makes around 15x bet per hand. This is more than the 9x bet max you can put out, and that's due to getting trips, two pair, etc. 
* Given a middle pair, like 8x8x, there's a 30% chance you win and a 70% chance you push. Make around 8x bet per hand. 
* Given a low pair, like 5x5x, there's a 30% chance you win, a 70% chance you lose, and 0% chance of pushing. Make around 0.4x per hand. 

## Hand strengths probability for any pair
Given any pair, there's a 72% chance of getting a pair, 16% chance of two pair, 10% chance of trips, and 1% chance of full house. Quads are 1/4th the chance as a full house, so around 0.25%. 

## High cards stats
* Given two high cards, like KxQx, there's a 35% chance you win, 60% chance you lose, and 5% chance you push. 
  * This is the same whether the cards are suited or not. 
  * However, unsuited high cards return around 0.5x ante bet, while suited high cards return around 1x ante bet. 
    * This is entirely from flushes, straight flushes, and royal flushes.
  * ~50% chance only end up with a high card and lose max bets. 
  * 35% chance end up with a pair and push/win, 4% chance of getting two pair, 1.5% chance of trips, 0.6% chance of straight, and 1% chance of full house. 
    * This barely changes when the two high cards are suited. Flushes have around 0.8% chance, and straight/royal flushes around 1/20,000

## One High One Push card stats
* Given a high card and a medium card, like Kx9x, there's a 23% chance you win, 58% chance you lose, and 18% chance you push.
